# Telegram Bot Playground 🤖

Welcome to my little experiment zone!

This repo is where I’m exploring the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) and learning how to build bots using Python, specifically with the awesome [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

## 🚀 What is this?
This is **not** a fully polished, production-ready bot. It’s a hands-on playground to:
- Understand how Telegram bots work
- Learn about handlers, filters, and the Telegram update flow
- Practice using environment variables and clean code structure
- Build a foundation for bigger bot projects later

## 💡 Features so far
- Command and message handlers
- `.env` support for tokens (no hardcoding!)
- Clean modular structure
- Easy to extend and experiment with new features

## 🛠️ Setup & Running
### 1️⃣ Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-bot-repo.git
cd your-bot-repo
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set up your `.env`
```
TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
BOT_USERNAME=@your_bot_username_here
```

### 4️⃣ Run it
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🤔 Why do this?
Because building and breaking things is the fastest way to learn. Docs are fine, but a bot that answers you in Telegram? 100x more powerful.

This repo is a log of my experiments — feel free to fork it, suggest changes, or just watch me mess around.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a **learning project**, so:
- Things might break
- Code might be messy
- Stuff will change often

If you want a stable production bot, look elsewhere (for now 😉).
